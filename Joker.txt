It occurs to me that as I am not a jester, that the following two files should be re-named.
...jest.config.js and
...jest.replay.config.js
In the spirit of fairness for all jokers everywhere the proposed new names should be obvious but just in case
...Joker.config.js and
...Joker.replay.config.js are the proposed new names and it is my hope that those maintaining the vercel/next.js open 
source code will give due consideration to this change.
