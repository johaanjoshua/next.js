I am now disconcerted and full of angst over finding out that as per the dictates of an indifferent universe the code for vercel/next.js
contains no less than five files that ignore the inevitable outcome of life and may hasten my demise. Was Lincoln ignored during the 
Civil War? I think not and neither shall I be. The files in question follow:
....eslintignore
....git-blame-ignore-revs
....gitignore
....ignore
....prettierignore
I did not do it I tell ya.
